## Remaining tasks

Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/join-snapcrafters/1325)) 
are working to land snap install documentation and
the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml)
upstream so cheat can authoritatively publish future releases.

  - [x] Click the green "Use this template" button above to create a new repository based on this template
  - [x] Give the newly created repository a sensible name, like `godzilla-snap` if you're snapping the Godzilla software
  - [x] Fork the [Snapcrafters template](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me) repository to your own GitHub account.
    - If you have already forked the Snapcrafter template to your account and want to create another snap, you'll need to use GitHub's [Import repository](https://github.com/new/import) feature because you can only fork a repository once.

  - [x] Publish the `devmode` snap in the Snap store edge channel

  - [-] Make a post in the [Snapcraft Forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io) asking for a transfer of the snap name from you to snapcrafters - [link]()
  - [-] Ask a [Snapcrafters admin](https://github.com/orgs/snapcrafters/people?query=%20role%3Aowner) to fork your repo into github.com/snapcrafters, and configure the repo for automatic publishing into edge on commit
  - [x] Add the provided Snapcraft build badge to this `README.md`
  - [x] Publish the snap in the Snap store stable channel
  - [x] Update the install instructions in this `README.md`
  - [ ] Post an announcement in the [Snapcraft Forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io) - [link]()
