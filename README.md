Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/join-snapcrafters/1325)) 
are working to land snap install documentation and
the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml)
upstream so cheat can authoritatively publish future releases.

  - [x] Fork the [Snapcrafters template](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me) repository to your own GitHub account.
    - If you have already forked the Snapcrafter template to your account and want to create another snap, you'll need to use GitHub's [Import repository](https://github.com/new/import) feature because you can only fork a repository once.
